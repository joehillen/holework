/**
 * Function: io_service()
 *
 * Returns a reference to the io_service object for the boostcraft system.
 *
 * Various parts of the boostcraft system can use this object to schedule
 * tasks, create timers, or perform other asynchronous activities.
 *
 * Boostcraft is run by executing io_service::run in (potentially) several
 * threads; all tasks are done asynchronously through the io_service, which
 * means that tasks might be picked up by any thread that is executing
 * io_service::run. This means: minimize shared mutable state if you can, and
 * use boost::asio::strand for any callbacks that access state that must be
 * synchronized (or else do your own locking of entire objects with mutexes,
 * but beware the vile deadlock beast!).

/**
 * Events in boostcraft are exposed through a set of public classes, one for
 * each type of event that can occur in the system. Each event class includes
 * a static boost::signals2::signal which is used for all instances of that
 * event.
 *
 * To raise an event, create an instance of the desired event class and call
 * fire() on it, e.g.:
 *         LogEvent log("This is a log message.");
 *         fire(log);
 * Alternatively, call async_fire() if you want handling of the event to occur
 * asynchronously.
 *
 * To listen for events, create a function that matches the signature
 * void(EventType&), and then call listen() on it, e.g.:
 *         void logHandler(LogEvent& e) { ... }
 *         listen(logHandler);
 * Your handler will be called whenever the event is fired, unless a handler
 * that ran prior to yours canceled the event. To request that your handler be
 * called even when the event was canceled, use listen_always.
